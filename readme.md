This repository is a collection of pratices and corresponding papers related to Generative Adversarial Networks. 

*01 to 06 are based on [tenforflow official tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/style_transfer).*

01: **Neural Style Transfer** --- transfer an image to a certain style based on the paper [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
